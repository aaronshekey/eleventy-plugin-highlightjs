# eleventy-plugin-highlightjs

A pack of [Eleventy](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy) plugins for syntax highlighting. No browser/client JavaScript here, these highlight transformations are all done at build-time.

Inspired by and based on [11ty/eleventy-plugin-syntaxhighlight](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-plugin-syntaxhighlight).
